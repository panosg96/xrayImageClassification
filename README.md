# X-Ray Image Classification


### This project is part of the Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow course in Codecademy.
### The goal of this project is to create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on an X-ray scan of a patient. The possible outcomes are "No illness", "Covid-19" and "Pneumonia". 
### The method was based on the previous articles and projects of the course, and was entirely developed by me.
### The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle. Due to size file limits reasons, it hasn't been included in the project files, but it can be easily downloaded through the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset and then placed in the directory of the rest of the files. 

#### This project was developed in codecademy's online platform.
